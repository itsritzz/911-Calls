# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - 911 Call Data

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and visualizations for an EDA project on 911 call data. In this project, we analyze a dataset containing emergency call information to gain insights and answer various questions about the data. The dataset includes information such as location, call description, timestamp, and more.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [911 Call Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert).

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- Data and Setup: Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
- Basic Questions: Answering fundamental questions about the data.
- Creating New Features: Adding new features to the dataset.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to explore the data.
- Heatmap Analysis: Analyzing data based on day of the week and hour.
- Clustermap Analysis: Examining data based on day of the week and month.

## Analysis Questions
The project aims to answer several key questions, including:
1. What are the top 5 zip codes for 911 calls?
2. What are the top 5 townships for 911 calls?
3. How many unique title codes are there?
4. What is the most common reason for a 911 call?
5. How do the number of calls vary by month and day of the week?

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express

## Heatmap and Clustermap
The heatmap and clustermap provide a visual representation of how calls are distributed across different days of the week and hours, as well as across months. These visualizations help us understand patterns and trends in the data.

## Conclusions
The EDA of 911 call data has provided valuable insights into emergency call patterns. The findings can be useful for resource allocation and optimizing emergency response services.
